## [1.10.0]
### What's Changed
This release is focused on **presence detection**. We can now detect the presence and absence of trackers devices like TILE, NUT, BlueCharm (and other models identified [here](https://decoder.theengs.io/devices/devices.html), the gateway will publish an offline message after tracker_timeout (120s per default) to set your controller to "Away" status.
Added to this, Apple Watch, iPhone, and iPad can be used for presence detection with the usage of their IRK.
And of course numerous other enhancements detailed below, thanks @DigiH and @koenvervloesem !

## [1.3.2]
Small maintenance release to fix a [bug](https://github.com/theengs/gateway/pull/84) when installing.

## [1.3.1]
Small maintenance release to align the decoder version between OpenMQTTGateway, the gateway and the app, and some minor changes.
## What's Changed
- [DOCS] Add discovery options to docker use by @1technophile in #69
- Improve install instructions by @1technophile in #70

- Code style cleanup with black, flake8 and isort by @koenvervloesem in #77

## [1.3.0]
A big release for Theengs Gateway, @DigiH did a huge work adding new devices and improving the existing ones!

Also, the TheengsGateway auto discovery following HA convention can be compatible now with other controllers like OpenHAB thanks to the work of @koenvervloesem #62 , just set `hass_discovery` to 0 if you use [OpenHAB](https://www.openhab.org/) or other Home Controllers.

I added documentation to the Theengs satellite/proxy feature that was available in the previous release. If you use OpenMQTTGateway [web upload](https://docs.openmqttgateway.com/upload/web-install.html) binary `esp32dev-ble-mqtt-undecoded` that will publish directly to `home/<gateway name>/BTtoMQTT/undecoded` making it directly compatible with Theengs Gateway MQTTtoMQTT decoding feature. In short, you can have satellites ESP32 sending undecoded data to TheengsGateway, and TheengsGateway centralizing the decoding work.
