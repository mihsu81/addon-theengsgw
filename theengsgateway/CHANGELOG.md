## [1.3.0]
A big release for Theengs Gateway, @DigiH did a huge work adding new devices and improving the existing ones!

Also, the TheengsGateway auto discovery following HA convention can be compatible now with other controllers like OpenHAB thanks to the work of @koenvervloesem #62 , just set `hass_discovery` to 0 if you use [OpenHAB](https://www.openhab.org/) or other Home Controllers.

I added documentation to the Theengs satellite/proxy feature that was available in the previous release. If you use OpenMQTTGateway [web upload](https://docs.openmqttgateway.com/upload/web-install.html) binary `esp32dev-ble-mqtt-undecoded` that will publish directly to `home/<gateway name>/BTtoMQTT/undecoded` making it directly compatible with Theengs Gateway MQTTtoMQTT decoding feature. In short, you can have satellites ESP32 sending undecoded data to TheengsGateway, and TheengsGateway centralizing the decoding work.
